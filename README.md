# Building the Reports
Make sure to have */bin/bash* installed in this exact path.
A UNIX-like system is required in order to run this.
The build system is still rudimental, room for improvement.

- Example for building the first Report:

```
git clone 
cd argosoft
cd Report_1
chmod +x compile.sh && ./compile.sh
```

- Open Report_1.pdf with your pdf viewer
